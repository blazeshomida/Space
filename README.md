## Overview

### The challenge

This project, as mentioned earlier, is a solution to the Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor. The challenge is aimed to help developers improve their coding skills by building realistic projects.

As a first multi-page website, it was a significant challenge that tested and expanded my skills. The journey was not a smooth one. It pushed me to my limits and nudged me to step out of my comfort zone. It took some getting used to as I had to adapt to a new mindset of dealing with multiple pages, which I hadn't done before.

Through this challenge, I gained a deeper understanding of the working and structuring of multi-page sites. It was a transformative learning experience that has set a new standard for my future projects.

In the screenshot above, you can see the final result of my space tourism website project. The website is a multi-page site with a user-friendly interface and vibrant visuals that encapsulate the essence of space exploration. The pages are neatly structured, with each page providing relevant and interesting information about space tourism.

## My process

### Built with

Throughout this project, I implemented and used a variety of different technologies that helped bring the project to life:

- React: This project was my maiden venture into using React. It was a learning experience, getting to know how to handle components and states within React.

- CSS Modules: For managing the background images and setting up grid areas for the layout, I used CSS modules. It made managing layout shifts for different devices much more manageable.

- Framer Motion: To add some flair to the project, I implemented animations using Framer Motion.

- Tailwind CSS: For most of the project, I utilized Tailwind CSS for its simplicity and intuitive design. However, I found that as things got more complex, like for my grid layouts, I needed to move beyond Tailwind for my grid-template-areas.

Each of these tools brought its own strengths to the project, and I learned a lot about when and how to use them effectively.

### What I learned

This project was a profound learning experience for me. Being my first multi-page site, it introduced me to new concepts and challenged my existing skills.

- React: Working with React was both challenging and rewarding. There was a steep learning curve but once I started to understand the concept of components and states, it became an exciting journey.

- Structuring Files and Components: One of the struggles I faced was figuring out how to structure my files and components. It was a new concept for me, but as I navigated through the project, I began to understand the significance and efficiency of componentization.

- Managing Background Images: Ensuring high quality of the background images while being responsive was a challenging task. I had to try different methods and finally landed on using CSS modules, which ended up being very effective.

- Managing Active Page in Navigation: Figuring out how to get the paths for each page to pass down to the nav to show which page is active was a unique challenge. It was particularly tricky when a user directly navigates to a page.

This project was indeed a journey of discovery and learning. The complexities I faced helped me grow as a developer and made me more confident in tackling new challenges.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I am aware there's a lot more to learn and refine. The completion of this project has not only given me a sense of accomplishment but also an array of learning avenues to explore further.

- More React: I plan to continue honing my skills in React. With this project, I've just scraped the surface of what this powerful library can do, and I'm excited to delve deeper.

- Refining Project Structure: Although I've made strides in understanding how to structure my files and components, I believe there's room for improvement. I aim to learn more about best practices and efficient ways to structure larger projects.

- CSS Modules and Media Queries: The use of CSS modules and managing background images was a highlight of this project. I intend to experiment more with these in future projects to ensure seamless responsiveness and high-quality imagery.

- Active Navigation State: Getting the active state in navigation right was a new challenge for me. In future projects, I aim to refine this process further and make it more efficient.

- Feedback and Collaboration: This project was a solo endeavor. Going forward, I am keen to collaborate with other developers and receive feedback on my work. Constructive criticism is a great way to learn, and I am open to any thoughts or opinions from others.

My journey as a developer is ongoing, and with every new project, I aim to push my boundaries, learn new things, and improve on the existing skills. I am confident that with practice, I will grasp these concepts faster and better.

### Useful resources

Here are some key resources that played a vital role in the completion of this project:

- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/learn) - The official React documentation was indispensable for getting to grips with React's concepts and understanding how to work with it effectively.

- [NextJS Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - NextJS documentation was an excellent resource for understanding the principles and benefits of a hybrid static and server rendering.

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Tailwind's documentation was vital in figuring out how to use their utility-first classes to style my project efficiently.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Web Docs is always a go-to resource for understanding web technologies. It was incredibly helpful for getting a firm grasp on concepts like CSS modules and more.

- [WebDevSimplified's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/webdevsimplified) - This YouTube channel was a great source of practical examples and clear, concise explanations of web development concepts.

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) - Kevin's channel offered a wealth of knowledge, especially in terms of CSS. His clear and in-depth explanations are a fantastic resource for any developer.

These resources were instrumental in my journey through this project, and I recommend them to anyone who wishes to learn these concepts.
